# to-do-list
A web application that allows users to manage tasks efficiently. Users can add tasks, mark them as complete, and remove them. The app stores tasks in the local storage, ensuring data persistence across sessions. The ui features, such as stars, moon, marked and unmarked symbols are self made.
